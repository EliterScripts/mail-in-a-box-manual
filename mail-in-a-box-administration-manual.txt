CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer

exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and

subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of

authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the

purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific

works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later

claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse

and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any

purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may

contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the

further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain

reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and

efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation

of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a

Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright

and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work

and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her

Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal

effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be

protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and

Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited

to, the following:

 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,

 and translate a Work;

 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness

 depicted in a Work;

 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,

 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in

 a Work;

 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the

 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal

 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,

 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world

 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,

applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and

unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright

and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now

known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of

action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum

duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time

extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of

copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation

commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes

the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the

detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver

shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or

any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work

by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be

judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver

shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account

Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver

is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,

non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and

unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in

the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration

provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)

in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any

purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or

promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as

of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the

License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under

applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not

invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby

affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining

Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims

and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to

Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,

 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties

 of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,

 including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness

 for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or

 other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not

 discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons

 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation

 any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer

 disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions

 or other rights required for any use of the Work.

 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a

 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this

 CC0 or use of the Work.

Why?

The idea for this manual came about in conversation with @Eliter over on the Discourse Forums. Having an in-depth administration manual will help new-comers and maybe even veterans to Linux / MIAB to be able to setup and maintain their own mail server!What is Mail-In-A-Box?



About Mail-In-A-Box

Mail-in-a-Box lets you become your own mail service provider in a few easy steps. It’s sort of like making your own Gmail, but one you control from top to bottom.

Technically, Mail-in-a-Box turns a fresh cloud computer into a working mail server. But you don’t need to be a technology expert to set it up.

Development

Mail-in-a-Box is based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 64-bit and uses very-well-documented shell scripts and a Python management daemon to configure the system. Take a look at the system architecture diagram and security practices.

Development takes place on github at https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox.

Note that the goals of this project are to . . .

Make deploying a good mail server easy.

Promote decentralization, innovation, and privacy on the web.

Have automated, auditable, and idempotent system configuration.

Not make a totally unhackable, NSA-proof server (but see our security practices).

Not make something customizable by power users.

Additionally, this project has a Code of Conduct, which supersedes the goals above. Please review it when joining our community.

Mail-in-a-Box is dedicated to the public domain using CC0.

Joshua Tauberer (@JoshData) began this project in 2013 and is the primary maintainer. Thank you to all of the contributors!Why Build Mail-In-A-Box?

Mass electronic surveillance by governments revealed over the last several years has spurred a new movement to re-decentralize the web, a movement to empower individuals to be their own service providers again.

Although the core protocol of email, SMTP, is inherently decentralized, in practice email has become highly centralized because it is so damn difficult to implement the dozens of modern protocols that surround it. Mail-in-a-Box takes care of all of that, and no more.

This is important not just for privacy, but for the ability for the web to evolve and improve as it always has: through the ability of everyone to see how it works, tinker, and propose innovative changes.Special Acknowledgements

This project was inspired in part by the "NSA-proof your email in 2 hours" blog post by Drew Crawford, Sovereign by Alex Payne, and conversations with @shevski, @konklone, and @GregElin.

Mail-in-a-Box is similar to iRedMail and Modoboa.

Mail-in-a-Box is based on Postfix, Dovecot, Z-Push, Roundcube, Nextcloud, Apache SpamAssassin, Postgrey, Nginx, @konklone’s nginx config, and more.Is Mail-In-A-Box right for me?

Finding a Hosing Provider & Setting Up a Domain



What is Hosting and a Domain?

What is a Server? Why do I need one?

MIAB requires a server to run. A server is a computer specially designed to run server applications, typically to be powered on all day, all month, all year, non-stop. However, when we say "server" in a hardware context, it does not necessarily have to be server-grade hardware, it can be any computer.

While you can run MIAB on your computer at home, there are some considerations you should take, as that may not be the best option for you. See the (WIP) section for more detail on choosing a hosting provider.

There is a business model, where companies host your servers for you, for a minutely, hourly, or monthly cost, depending on your provider. These companies put servers, on shelves, in aisles, in data centers (which are warehouses designed for servers). Of course, they provide power and Internet to your servers too. They also keep the building, server hardware, electricity and network maintained, with many backups and security measures in place to make sure that your server experiences the lowest possible downtime.

What is a Domain? Why do I need one?

In a computer network, every computer is assigned an IP address to communicate. These IP addresses look like the following: 8.8.8.8 (for an IPv4 address) and 2001:4860:4860::8888 (for an IPv6 address). Since those addresses are difficult to remember, DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that converts words such as google.com (which is a domain) into an IP address.

Although you can technically setup a mail server without a domain, it will: make it difficult for users to remember your IP address, puts you in a position where you could be locked into a hosting provider, and MIAB is't really designed to work without a domain (or Fully Qualified Domain Name, FQDN, it might sometimes be called).

To get a domain, you must get it from a domain registrar.Installing & Preparing Ubuntu for Mail-In-A-Box

Getting Help

If you need help, please check the maintenance guide and then ask on the forum. If you think you have found a problem in Mail-in-a-Box or don’t get a response on the forum, then open an issue on github.

We will post announcements and security advisories to our twitter account @mailinabox, the announcements section of the discussion forum, and our Slack chat (see above).

Do not tweet questions: Always start on the forum so others can benefit from seeing your question too.

Reporting spam/fraud/abuse: Mail-in-a-Box actually isn’t a mail service at all. It is more like a cooking recipe for how to create a mail service — therefore, we have no way to know who is following the recipe and have no control over people baking our cake to hide a poison. Like cake, there are many recipes for creating email servers besides Mail-in-a-Box (Microsoft Exchange Server being one of the most popular), and we are just unlucky when sometimes someone with bad intentions choses ours. In other words, we don’t control how people use Mail-in-a-Box and have no technical or legal means to disable other people’s services. You may want to check out the Mail-in-a-Box discussion forum and coordinate with anyone that has reported a similar situation recently.
